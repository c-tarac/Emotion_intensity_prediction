## About

[AffectiveTweets](https://affectivetweets.cms.waikato.ac.nz/) is a [WEKA](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/) package for analyzing emotion and sentiment of English written tweets. 

The package implements WEKA filters for calculating state-of-the-art affective analysis features from tweets that can be fed into machine learning algorithms. Many of these features were drawn from the [NRC-Canada System](http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Canada-Sentiment.htm). It also implements methods for building affective lexicons and distant supervision methods for training affective models from unlabelled tweets.


The package was made available as the official baseline system for the [WASSA-2017](http://optima.jrc.it/wassa2017/) Shared Task on Emotion Intensity [(EmoInt)](http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/EmotionIntensity-SharedTask.html) and for [SemEval-2018](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2018/) Task 1: [Affect in Tweets](http://www.saifmohammad.com/WebPages/affectintweets.htm). 

Five participating teams used AffectiveTweets in WASSA-2017 to generate feature vectors, including the teams that eventually ranked first, second, and third. For SemEval-2018, the package was used by 15 teams.
